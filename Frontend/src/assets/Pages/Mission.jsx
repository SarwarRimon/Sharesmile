          At <span className="text-blue-500 font-semibold">ShareSmile</span>, our mission is to create a transparent and compassionate platform where those in need can find support, and those willing to help can contribute confidently. We aim to build a bridge between heartsâ€”connecting donors with underprivileged students, disaster-affected families, and helpless individuals across our university and beyond.
